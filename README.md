**Faable Cloud** is a platform for frontend frameworks and backend microservices to build and integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

We make it easy for develper teams to develop and ship awesome user experiences, where performance is the default.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started with Faable is to create an account and create a github action in your repository.

To deploy your app, start by Creating your account

- Sign-up into Faable with your github account and access the [Dashboard](https://www.faable.com/dashboard)
- Create a service and assign it a `<service_name>`

Prepare your Node.js or React app to be deployed:

- [Configure your project](docs/configuration.md)
- Obtain the `FAABLE_API_KEY` for your app service
- 👨🏼‍💻 [Configure your repository for automatic deployment with a Github action](docs/github-actions.md)
- 🚀 Your site is ready at: `<service_name>.app.faable.com`

To configure your app with a custom domain like `www.example.com` see [our custom domain guide](docs/custom-domain.md)
